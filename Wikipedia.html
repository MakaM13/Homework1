        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a website for the <strong>Internet</strong> (World Wide Web) or an <em>intranet</em> (a <mark>private network</mark>). 
            Web development can range from developing a <del>complex</del> <ins>simple</ins> single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. 
            A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. 
            The term <i>Web</i> is often used as a synonym for the <sub>WWW</sub> (World Wide Web)<sup>[1]</sup>.

        <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web development</h2>

        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>
            Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at <b>CERN</b>, invented the World Wide Web in 1989. 
            Web 1.0 refers to the first stage of the World Wide Web evolution. 
            Earlier, there were only a few <i>content creators</i> in Web 1.0 with the huge majority of users who are consumers of content. 
            Personal web pages were common, consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers, or on free web hosting services. 
            Here, data was <strong>static</strong> rather than dynamic.
        </p>

        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 2.0 refers to websites that emphasize <mark>user-generated content</mark>, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. 
            The term was popularized by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in late 2004, though it was coined by Darcy DiNucci in 1999. 
            Examples include social media sites like <em>Facebook</em> and YouTube. 
            This era marked the shift from a <del>read-only</del> <ins>read-write</ins> web.
        </p>

        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 3.0, also known as the <sub>Semantic</sub> Web, is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. 
            Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 2.0, wherein they say data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as "Big Tech". 
            It aims to make the internet more intelligent<sup>[2]</sup>.
